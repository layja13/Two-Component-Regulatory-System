# AI-and-Adaptive-Systems
This repository  includes personal, academic, training, community contribution, and code optimization projects. It is created to cover different branches of Artificial Intelligence and Adaptive Systems. In a few years, I hope to have a substantial amount of content that can support people who want to learn, just like I do :)
